* Make buttons look like the rest of the application  (ALL)
* Move "First Name", "Last Name" check boxes to the left.  This might take changing from the "label" html control. (Don't need to maintain functionality)
* Make text a little smaller and closer together
* Make to the top box (File to Import) and the file selection two different boxes.
* Upload File and Apply should group together and Delete and Process File should be together
* Document the functionality - this will have to wait till later.


Advanced:

Later:
* Update drop down lists for actions to full name (skip, update, etc)

Bugs:
